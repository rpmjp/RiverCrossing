# 🌊 River Crossing Puzzle

A modern implementation of the classic river crossing logic puzzle with beautiful PyQt5 GUI and intelligent BFS solver.

## 🎮 Game Description

Help the farmer safely transport a lion, goat, and grass across the river! This classic logic puzzle challenges you to find the optimal sequence of moves while following strict safety rules.

**The Challenge:**
- 👨‍🌾 The farmer must transport everyone across the river
- 🚣 Only the farmer can operate the boat
- ⚖️ The boat can only carry the farmer plus ONE item at a time
- 🚫 **Critical Rule:** Lion cannot be alone with goat (lion will eat goat)
- 🚫 **Critical Rule:** Goat cannot be alone with grass (goat will eat grass)

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- PyQt5

### Quick Start
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/river-crossing-puzzle.git
   cd river-crossing-puzzle
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install PyQt5
   ```
   
   *Or using requirements.txt:*
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the game:**
   ```bash
   python River_Crossing_PyQt5_GUI.py
   ```

## 🎯 Features

### 🧠 Intelligent Solver
- **BFS Algorithm**: Uses Breadth-First Search to find the optimal solution
- **Guaranteed Optimal**: Always finds the shortest path (8 steps)
- **State Validation**: Prevents invalid moves that violate safety rules

### 🎨 Modern GUI
- **Professional Design**: Beautiful PyQt5 interface with gradients and effects
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded sides and character positioning
- **Smooth Animations**: Automated solving with step-by-step visualization
- **Responsive Layout**: Scales beautifully to different window sizes

### 🎮 Interactive Controls
- **🔍 Find Solution**: Discover the optimal path using BFS
- **▶️ Auto Solve**: Watch the solution unfold automatically
- **⏭️ Next Step**: Manually step through the solution
- **🔄 Reset**: Start over at any time

### 🛡️ Safety Features
- **Invalid State Detection**: Visual warnings when rules are violated
- **Move Validation**: Only allows legal moves
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of edge cases

## 🧮 Algorithm Details

The puzzle solver uses **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to guarantee finding the shortest solution:

1. **State Representation**: Each state is a 4-tuple `(farmer, lion, goat, grass)` where `False` = left side, `True` = right side
2. **Move Generation**: From each state, generate all valid moves (farmer alone or with one item)
3. **Validation**: Ensure no invalid states (predator-prey combinations without farmer)
4. **Optimal Path**: BFS explores all possibilities level by level, ensuring the first solution found is optimal

**Time Complexity**: O(2^4) = O(16) states maximum  
**Space Complexity**: O(16) for visited states tracking  
**Solution Length**: 8 steps (optimal)
